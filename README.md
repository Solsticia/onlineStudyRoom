# onlineStudyRoom


A quiet, online study room. 
Inspired by the game Fruit Ninja. 

Feel free to turn off the music if you feel distracted. 


The inspiration for the timer:
When grinding math, I want a timer with a plain and modest background. 
The windows built-in one is less easy to set, and I dislike the white background-it hurts my eyes somehow. 
While the online ones, practical, but they are always too fancy. 
Thus motivates me to create the simple timer on my webpage. 

Hope you will like it!
